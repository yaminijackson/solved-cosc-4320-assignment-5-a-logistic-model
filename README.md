Question:

A logistic Model is given as

<strong>x<sub>t</sub> = r x<sub>t-1</sub> (1- x<sub>t-1 </sub>)  </strong>

Do the following:

<ol>

 <li>Conduct a bifurcation analysis of this model to find the critical thresholds of r at which Bifurcation occurs</li>

 <li>Study stability of each equilibrium point in each parameter range and summarize the result in a table</li>

 <li> Simulate The model with several selected values of r to confirm the result analysis.</li>

 <li>Plot a Bifurcation diagram of this model for 0 &lt; r &lt; 4</li>

</ol>
